# mail-server-project
This is a project to build a linux based messaging system for LMM Labs projects as quickly as possible.  We have chosen to build this environment with the iRedMail package for Linux.  We may build something from scratch in the future but this appears to be a clean, robust and efficient way to go. If it works, it will definitely meet our needs and then some!

This repository contains the tar file with the code release of iRedMail for this project.  The version is 0.9.8.
